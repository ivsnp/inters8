## Paper abstract

This paper presents our research conducted on the detection of online misogyny on social media and its intersection 
with other hate categories. Focusing on the phenomenon of misogyny, we carried out a corpus-based data analysis around 
victims of online hate campaigns. Targets were selected to study how misogyny and sexism intersect with other 
categories of social hatred and discrimination such as xenophobia, racism, and Islamophobia.  
This study includes an event-driven analysis of hate on Twitter concerning specific targets, the process of developing 
the _Inters8_ corpus, and its manual annotation according to a novel multi-level schema designed to assess the presence 
of intersectional hatred.
