# Annotation guidelines ENG (translated)

**WARNING**: this document contains examples of potentially offensive content.

---

The collection consists of a selection of tweets regarding debates about Silvia Romano; below the words "target" and "victim" will be used to refer to her.

This section describes the annotation schema and some useful examples for recognizing the main explicit and implicit forms of discrimination included in this case study.

## Notes

The consensus, religious conversion, and alleged promise of marriage occurred in the very sensitive context of 
imprisonment in Kenya. The tweets to be annotated were posted in the first days of arrival in Italy, so public 
information regarding the dynamics of the event was uncertain. Given this premise, stereotyping pregnancy, religious 
conversion, and the promise of marriage by shifting blame onto the target audience should be considered discriminatory 
attitudes.

**Implicit and explicit forms of discrimination should be marked "YES "**, the objectives include studying forms of the 
phenomenon at multiple levels of intensity.

If you have any doubts about the annotation schema and guidelines, we are at your disposal.

## Context

Silvia Romano is an Italian girl who was kidnapped on November 20, 2018 in Kenya. She was freed on May 9, 2020, and 
arrived the following day in Italy, enlivening the debate in news outlets and on social media about her possible 
ransom, humanitarian volunteer work, her pregnancy, alleged marriage, and the girl's religious conversion to Islam.

## Glossary

Given the annotation schema, below is the description of the labels:

- **Misogynistic behavior**: any form of aversion or repulsion toward women.
  - **Sexual harassment** and/or **derailing**: includes avances, requests for sexual favors, and any form of harassment involving sex or speech in which abuse of women is justified by rejecting, or ignoring, male responsibility.
  - **Discredit** and/or **dominance**: discredit is spoken of when an individual S, through a communicative act, damages the image of another individual T in front of a third party (individual or group A) by referring to actions or characteristics of T that are considered negative by A. There are various forms of discredit that can be expressed through the use of speech and are often related to physical characteristics, skills (including affective) and, in the context of misogynistic discourse, often also to *dominance*, which in the specific case is typically expressed as an assertion of male superiority over women by highlighting gender inequality.
- **Xenophobia** and/or **racism**: includes aversion to foreigners and what is foreign, manifested in attitudes and actions of impatience and hostility toward the customs, culture, and inhabitants of other countries. It also includes the advocacy of the existence of superior and inferior races.
- **Islamophobia**: aversion to Islamic culture and religion.
- **Prevalence**: indicates which of the three main categories of discrimination, covered in this study, prevails over the others.
- **Stereotypes**: means a generalization conducted about a group of people, in which identical characteristics are attributed to all members of the group. Stereotyping is based on a set of beliefs, not based on experience, that people put in place to interpret their surroundings and move through them. Stereotyping is not based on scientific knowledge, but on classification into very rigid and generalizing categories, without taking into account possible exceptions. Many of our stereotypes stem from the culture in which we live and run the risk of giving rise to prejudice. It includes stereotypes of any type.
- **Target defense**: means whether the tweet defends the target subject.
- **Stance**: given a child tweet A to annotate that responds to another parent tweet B, it indicates the kind of stance the user who posted tweet A takes toward the target audience.

## Annotation instructions

Following the glossary definitions, note for each tweet:

1. **Misogynistic Behavior**: YES or NO. Answer whether at least one form of misogyny (explicit or implicit) is Present or Absent in the tweet. Includes aversions/repulsions toward women including hatred and prejudice, also includes shushing the target audience. 
   - *If MISOGYNY = YES, ALSO RESPOND TO POINTS 2 and 3* which allow a finer-grained characterization of misogynistic behavior. This fine-grained annotation is inspired by that proposed in the AMI 2018@EVALITA18 shared task (Fersini *et al*., 2018):
2. **Sexual harassment** and/or **derailing**: YES or NO. Answer whether any form of sexual harassment (explicit and implicit) or derailing is Present or Absent in the tweet.
3. **Discredit** and/or **dominance**: YES or NO. Specify whether any form of discredit or dominance based on gender (explicit and implicit) is Present or Absent in the tweet. Include all content that belittles the target audience because they are female or under intend a rhetoric of male superiority. 
4. **Xenophobia** and/or **racism**: YES or NO. Answer whether any form of xenophobia or racism (explicit or implicit) is Present or Absent in the tweet.
5. **Islamophobia**: YES or NO. Answer whether any form of Islamophobia (explicit or implicit) is Present or Absent in the tweet. 
6. **Prevalence**: MISOGYNY, XENOPHOBIA/ RACISM, ISLAMOPHOBIA, or ABSENT. (Answer only if at least two of misogyny, xenophobia/racism, or Islamophobia have "YES" value). Respond by selecting the category that prevails over the others within the tweet.
7. **Stereotypes**: YES or NO. Answer whether stereotypes are Present or Absent within the tweet.
8. **Target Defense**: YES or NO. Answer whether any form of target advocacy is Present or Absent.
9. **Stance**: Support, Contestation, Neutral or Absent. Specify the type of reaction of the tweet to another to which it is responding, if any. If the parent tweet is not present, and therefore the tweet is not a response to another, the default value is "Absent."

## Preliminary considerations on the dataset

Below are some dynamics and examples strongly related to this case study.

We want to consider among the implicit forms of **misogyny** and **discrediting** the instrumentalization of Silvia 
Romano's **pregnancy** and alleged **marriage** for the purpose of discrediting the victim and blaming her as if it 
was "her fault" (this is one of the narratives also present around the abuse). 

It is considered **xenophobic** any discourse that describes migrants, or uses the term "*Africans*" and related, to 
highlight a distance between the writer and other people with backgrounds different from theirs following a narrative 
of superiority. Similarly, it is also **xenophobia** when Silvia Romano is treated as "no longer Italian" and 
therefore without the right to be freed and brought to Italy just because she went to volunteer in the *third world* 
and returned to Italy converted to Islam. 

Moreover, the term "*terrorist*" is often used as a synonym for Muslim or Islamic therefore it is another way to 
manifest **Islamophobia**. Some tweets seem to be seemingly non-Islamophobic but with exclusively a negative 
connotation, however, if the hashtag **#converted** (or similar) is present, the content becomes **Islamophobic** 
since the aversion to the target is justified because of her religious conversion for which she has full rights.
